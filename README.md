# Web Application Configuration

We will create the frontend with a Angular project.
The web application is placed within the moviedb.webapp folder.

The project hierarchy will be:
*All new angular components will be placed within the components folder
*Every angular component should have it's own angular service, but they may share some global services.
*Every new application component shall be declared in the app.module.ts file, according to it's usage.
*Whatever data model we present on the backend shall be mirrored in the frontend, to the extent of it's usage.
